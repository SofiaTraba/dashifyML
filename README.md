# Dashify

A lightweight tool to manage your large scale machine leaning experiments. Dashify contains two individual components, namely a multiprocessing capable logging component and a web-based visualization component.

Please note, that Dashify is currently under heavy development, such that interfaces are still likely to change in the future. Every change will be noted in each version's change log. 

## Getting Started

### Install

Create a dashify folder, cd into this folder and clone the repository 

```
mkdir dashify_repo
cd dashify_repo
git clone git@github.com:le1nux/dashify.git
```

To install cd into the repository and install the package

```
cd dashify
pip install src/
```
For the future, dashify will be easily installable directly from the pip repositories.

### Track an experiment


### Run the visualization tool

## Architecture

## Contribute

We are always looking forward to more people getting involved with this project. If you have questions, feedback, feature requests or bugs please create an issue and we will come back to you. Additionally, if you want to actively contribute codewise, please take a look at our board, where we collect issues in a backlog. If you implemented a feature or fixed a bug, please feel free to write a pull request. 

## The Team

Dashify is developed by Rajkumar Ramamurthy, Max Lübbering, Lars Patrick Hillebrand and Thiago Bell. We are convinced that every machine learning training should easily analyzed no matter how complex it gets. Our story started in our everyday work at Fraunhofer IAIS, in which were troubled by all the training visualization tools out there. Each of them not giving us the flexibility, scalability that we actually think is needed. 

This is why we started started the Dashify project and herewith, finally open sourced it. 

We are confident that with Dashify the analysis of machine learning algorithms becomes a great deal easier. 

For contact, please drop us an email: TBD
